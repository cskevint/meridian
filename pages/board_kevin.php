Kevin, a Salvadorian native, came to the US when he was awarded an educational grant to attend California Institute of Technology, where he studied Computer Science and Economics. After graduation, he joined the Oracle Corporation where he specialized in web application development.  He currently is a software engineer at C3 Energy in Silicon Valley. Kevin’s main focus outside of work is the Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Program. After getting trained in “Releasing the Powers of Junior Youth” in August 2006, he has been working with junior youth groups and their animators all over Northern California. In December 2009, he moved to North Central San Mateo in order to dedicate a period of 10 years to the growth of the program in that neighborhood. His passion for working with this age group causes him to spend many hours a week with junior youth, looking for potential collaborators, talking to their parents about the program and engaging in the reading, art, service and recreational activities that are part of the programs. Kevin currently serves on the Regional Baha’i Council for the State of California, which is charged with supporting the Baha’i Community in the state and helping coordinate their community building endeavours.
