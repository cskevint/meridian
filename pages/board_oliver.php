Oliver, a Mauritius native, graduated in 2006 from the National University of Singapore, with a Bachelor in Computer Science. Coupled with an 18-month stint in Silicon Valley studying technological entrepreneurship at Stanford University, Oliver acquired the necessary skills to start his own company. In 2008, he co-founded Peekspy, a Singapore startup solving a problem millions of sports fans and concert-goers were experiencing around the world. Peekspy allowed the fans to see their view from their seat inside a venue before even purchasing their tickets. In March 2012, StubHub, the worldâ€™s largest online ticket marketplace owned by eBay, acquired Peekspy. Oliver is now a fulltime software engineer at StubHub. In the evenings, Oliver serves as a junior youth animator. He is interested in neighborhood community development, and works with groups of 11 to 15 year old youth for the material and spiritual progress of the community. Through the various service projects initiated by the groups of youth, they gradually transform the neighborhood into one where unity reigns and in turn develops their increasing capacities for serving humanity. Oliver is fluent in French, Mauritian Creole as well as English.
