    The work we do is primarily in neighborhoods where groups meet in homes, community centers and schools.

    The initial space for learning is in Central San Mateo California, east of El Camino Real between Poplar and  3 Ave.  There are some 10 neighborhoods in Northern California with a similar focus, as well as neighborhoods all over the country and villages around the world that implement the Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Program.  This model is designed to be replicable. This target audience may in turn interact with children (ages 4-10) and with adults through their service projects.
